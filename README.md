### I'm Game Programer that have worked with Unreal Engine & Unity.

I studied an **Informatics Ingeniering Degree** at Burgos University. I focused my studies at university on **Sofware Ingeniering**.

After that I studied **Game Programming Master's Degree** at U-Tad, Madrid. In that master I learned the basics of how to make video games as well as the necessary knowledge to create your own game engine. Also I worked with **Unreal Engine** and **Unity** game engines.

For my master tesis I made a third person action-adventure game with othe 15 students named **Howl Of Iron**. Its was nice opportunity to work with a large team. together we bring out the best in ourselves to the point that we managed to win the award for **best game design** at the pstalents awards.

I love videogames. Since I was young I have always had a portable console or a controller in my hands. I have played games of almost any genre. My favorite game genres are **hack and slash** and **turn based** games. I specially love **Nier: Automata** and **God Of War**.

Furthermore I like **anime** and **table games**. I love so many animes I can't mention just one, but my favourite table game is **Magic The Gathering**.
